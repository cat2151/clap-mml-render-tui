# Breaking Changes
- Frequent daily breaking changes are introduced.

# Roadmap
- Option to disable automatic updates via TOML; in that case, upon quitting, an "update available" message will display the update command. Further automation has been determined to be outside the scope due to its complexity outweighing its benefits.

# Out of Scope
- Effects are likely to require editing, so for now, they are considered out of scope and will be deferred to a much later stage.
